                    return to the previously focused hubs item, instead of the
                    closest one. (fixes erroneous shifting)
       Grid screen: Refocus the last focused grid item between the filter options
                    (top) and jump list (bottom). Also fixes focusing the filters
                    before any header button, when pressing up from the grid.

                    item when moving between list and other areas (action bar)
      Shows screen: Retain where we came from in both directions (up/down), from
                    the action bar and seasons grid.
